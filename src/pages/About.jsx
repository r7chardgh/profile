        I am a frondend developer, graduated from Hong Kong University of Science and Technology with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science. I love coding and playing video games (especially FPS). I like chess and minecraft IC2 (you know ...... logic stuff). I go to the gym regularly and I've been dragon boating (can you guess?).
